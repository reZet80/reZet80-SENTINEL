SENTINEL LCD specs
------------------

The 16x1 display card dispalys 16 characters in one line.

Hitachi's HD44780 dot matrix LCD controller is both CMOS and TTL compatible.

The display card uses port address 70 (I/O signal /IOSEL_7X).
The address is given in hexadecimal notation.

LCD modules provide a parallel interface bus as follows:
LCDB01: GND
LCDB02: VCC
LCDB03: V0
LCDB04: RS (A0)
LCDB05: R/W (/RD inverted)
LCDB06: E
LCDB07: D0
LCDB08: D1
LCDB09: D2
LCDB10: D3
LCDB11: D4
LCDB12: D5
LCDB13: D6
LCDB14: D7
LCDB15: VCC backlight
LCDB16: GND backlight

The LCD samples data when the E signal changes from high to low.
Unfortunately the Z80 signals /IORQ and /WR go from high to low at the same
time. So the /WR signal is not asserted any longer for data to be written to
the LCD. The solution is to use the inverted /RD instead of the /WR signal.
The address and data lines are kept asserted after /IORQ and /WR go low.

A variable resistor connected to V0 is used to set the display contrast.
Depending on your LCD specs an extra resistor is needed in series with VCC
backlight.

Bill of materials:
- 1x 16x1 LCD display
- 1x resistor X (choose according to your LCD specs)
- 1x variable resistor 4k7
- 1x capacitor 100 nF
