SENTINEL keyboard specs
-----------------------

The SENTINEL keyboard provides alphanumericals '0'-'9' and 'A'-'Z,
twenty-eight punctuation symbols and seven special keys:
ENTER, BACK, ESC, SHIFT, ALT1, ALT2 and ALT3.

The 74C923 chip supports key debouncing and interrupts.
It triggers /NMI once a key is pressed.
The NMI is used because it has the fastest interrupt response time.

The keyboard card uses port address 60 (I/O signal /IOSEL_6X).
The address is given in hexadecimal notation.
ALT1, ALT2 and ALT3 key presses are sensed via the status register.

The keyboard bus:
KEYB01: D4
KEYB02: D3
KEYB03: D2
KEYB04: D1
KEYB05: D0
KEYB06: /IOSEL_6X
KEYB07: NMI (DA)
KEYB08: ALT1
KEYB09: ALT2
KEYB10: ALT3
KEYB11: GND
KEYB12: +5V
