SENTINEL CLI README
-------------------

CLI stands for Command Line Interface.
It is the software that enables you to enter and run commands.

After reset you will see the welcome string showing "SENTINEL R0".
Press any key to get to the prompt: '>'.
Alphanumericals and punctuation symbols that you enter are displayed from
left to right but only fifteen can be entered and are visible.
All following entries are ignored.
So you cannot type beyond the end of the line.
The BACK key moves you one digit to the left.
But you cannot go back past the prompt.
Press ENTER when you have finished entering your command.
The ESC key takes you back to an empty prompt.

The ALT keys serve the purpose of switching between the blocks of available
characters and punctuation symbols as only 16 keys are available at a time.
The default keys:
'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'

With ALT2 the following characters and punctuation symbols are available:
