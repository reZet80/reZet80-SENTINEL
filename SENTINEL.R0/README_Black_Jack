SENTINEL Black Jack README
--------------------------

Welcome to the two-player game Black Jack!
To start the game enter "BJ" at the prompt and press ENTER.
The display reads "BLACK JACK". Press any key to begin.

The game screen looks like this: "XUP TT CCCCCC HH".
"XUP" is either "1UP" for player 1 or "2UP" for player 2.
"TT" is the hand total of the current player.
"C" are the cards drawn by the player:
"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A".
"T" stands for "10".
"HH" is the hand total of player 1, it will only be displayed for player 2.
If you bust your hand total will be "00".
Press ENTER for the next card or ESC to end your turn.

After both players have finished their turn the game results are displayed.
So it's either "NOBODY WINS" or "XX > YY 1UP WINS" or "YY > XX 2UP WINS".
The hand total of both winner and second placed player are displayed,
"XX" is the hand total of player 1 and "YY" the hand total of player 2.
Press ESC to quit the game or any other key to restart.

Playing against the computer is not supported yet but you can play against
yourself :-)
I presume you know the Black Jack rules :-)
Enjoy!
