reZet80 README
--------------

Welcome to reZet80!
reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".
reZet80 features a set of retro projects to develop computing and
arcade systems that resemble the Z80 machines of the 70s and 80s.
All systems are built from scratch and not copies of any other Z80 system.
The development process includes low-level hardware design and software
programming in Assembler.
I will develop and build every single pcb trace and every single bit of
machine code by myself.
DIYIB: Doing it yourself is believing!
WYDYIWYG: What you do yourself is what you get!

My active stand-alone computer system projects that use the powerful Z80:

- 7-segment display

SCOUT:
- Expandable SBC for 1977
- Up to 4 KiB of RAM and 12 KiB of ROM
- TIL311 hexadecimal display

PIONEER:
- Modular system for the late 70s
- Up to 28 KiB of RAM and 14 KiB of ROM
- Extended 14-segment 16-char display

HYBRID:
