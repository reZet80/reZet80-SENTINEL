SENTINEL Hex Man README
-----------------------

Welcome to the game Hexadecimal Hangman!
To start the game enter "HM" at the prompt and press ENTER.
The display reads "HEX MAN". Press any key to begin.

In Hex Man the player guesses hexadecimal numbers ('0'-'F'), not words.
The computer thinks up a word of random hexadecimal numbers.
The word length is also chosen randomly from one to eight numbers.
"_" placeholders are displayed for the word to guess.
Six incorrect guesses "#" are allowed (for head, body and limbs in hangman).
A "_" or a "#" will be replaced with your guessed number for a correct or
incorrect guess, respectively.
When the game ends it either displays "WINNER" or "LOSER".
Press ESC to quit the game or any other key to play again.

Strategies like using the most commonly occurring letters in the player's
language are no longer of any help.
It's up to your lucky guesses!
And this game removes the controversial hanging of people!

Enjoy!
