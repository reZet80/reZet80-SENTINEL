SENTINEL Hex Invaders README
----------------------------

Welcome to the game Hex Invaders!
Hex Invaders is inspired by Casio's MG-880 Calculator game from the 80s.
To start the game enter "HI" at the prompt and press ENTER.
The display reads "HEX INVADERS". Press any key to begin.

The game screen looks like this: "LG#IIIIIIII SCOR".
'#' is your base.
'L' shows your remaining lives. You start with three lives.
'G' is your gun (number).
'I' are the enemy invaders. They advance towards your base from the right.
Invaders always keep getting faster.
You shoot invaders by pressing the ENTER key.
You can only destroy the invaders that match your gun number.
You advance your gun number from '0' to 'F' and back to '0' by pressing the
BACK key.
"SCOR" is the score of all invaders you have hit.
Invaders, your gun number and the score are given in hexadecimal notation,
hence the name of the game.
If an invader hits your base you lose one life.
The game ends after you have lost all three lives.
Your final score and "GAME OVER" is displayed.
Press ESC to quit the game or any other key to restart.

Enjoy!
